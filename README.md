# Quizlet Terms Exporter

A collection of scripts written in Python and JavaScript to export terms and definitions from any Quizlet set. This repository is designed to provide multiple methods for scraping and exporting Quizlet content into a usable format.

I might add other tools to this repo in the future, but currently it's just a quizlet term exporter. ðŸ˜€

## Features

- Export terms and definitions from public Quizlet sets.
- Output in various formats such as JSON, CSV, or plain text.
- Scripts currently available in Python and JavaScript.
- Support for additional languages or formats can be added upon request.
